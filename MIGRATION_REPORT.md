- Optimized bundle sizes

## 📋 Migration Checklist

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Configuration layer setup
- [x] Core API architecture
- [x] Shared component library (atoms & molecules)
- [x] Hook library with essential hooks
- [x] Feature module structure (CRM, Agenda, GED, Admin)
- [x] Template components migration
- [x] Provider system organization
- [x] Main application entry point update
- [x] TypeScript type definitions
- [x] Import path standardization

### 🔄 In Progress

- [ ] Complete component migration from `/src/components/` to new structure
- [ ] Update all existing imports throughout the codebase
- [ ] Migrate remaining UI components to atomic design
- [ ] Create organism and template components
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error boundaries

### 📅 Next Phase

- [ ] Component documentation with Storybook
- [ ] Unit tests for all shared components
- [ ] Integration tests for feature modules
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility audit and improvements

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Import Organization**

```typescript
// Before (scattered imports)
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import MainLayout from "@/components/Layout/MainLayout";

// After (standardized imports)
import { Button, Input } from "@/shared/components/atoms";
import { MainLayout } from "@/shared/components/templates";
import { useClients } from "@/features/crm/hooks";
```

### 2. **Feature Structure**

```
features/crm/
├── components/     # CRM-specific components
├── hooks/         # CRM domain hooks
├── services/      # CRM API services
├── types/         # CRM TypeScript types
├── utils/         # CRM utilities
└── index.ts       # Clean exports
```

### 3. **Configuration Management**

```typescript
// Centralized configuration
import { API_ENDPOINTS } from "@/config/api";
import { FEATURE_FLAGS } from "@/config/features";
import { ROUTES } from "@/config/constants";
```

## 🚀 Benefits for Teams

### 1. **Parallel Development**

- Teams can work on different features without conflicts
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Independent deployment possibilities

### 2. **Code Quality**

- Consistent patterns reduce bugs
- Type safety catches errors early
- Standardized components ensure UI consistency

### 3. **Onboarding**

- Clear architecture makes codebase approachable
- Documented patterns speed up learning
- Consistent structure reduces confusion

## 📖 Next Steps

1. **Complete Component Migration**: Move remaining components to new structure
2. **Update Import Paths**: Systematic update of all import statements
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for new architecture
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed component documentation
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up metrics for the new architecture

## 🎉 Migration Success
